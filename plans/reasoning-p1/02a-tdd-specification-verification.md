# Phase 02a – Verification of TDD Specification (reasoning-p1)

## Verification Steps
1. `npm run typecheck` – must exit with code 0.
2. `npx vitest list | grep tests/openai-responses.spec.ts` – file must be present.
3. `npx vitest run tests/openai-responses.spec.ts || true` – ensure **all tests fail**.
4. Confirm no production files changed since Phase 01 (git diff `src/` should be empty).
5. Confirm checklist items in `02-tdd-specification.md` are ticked.

## Outcome
Emit `✅` if all checks succeed; otherwise list `❌` failures.
