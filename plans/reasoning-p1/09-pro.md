Quick scorecard - “06-pro.md” vs. the current behaviour

Checklist step	Status	Evidence from your latest run
Gate-switch (useResponses) defaults to true for o3/o4	❌ not done	Log still shows the “Chat completion” path, so the code never entered client.responses.create.
buildResponsesRequest() sends only the new user text	❌ not done	Model echoes the literal string “[object Object]” → you’re passing a JS object instead of plain text.
Call-site chooses responses.create when useResponses	⚠ partial	You probably added the branch (the compile passed) but because useResponses was false it never executed.
Streaming parser for typed SSE events	❌ not done	Heading “Chat streaming” prints but nothing follows; the code is still looking for choices[].delta.
transformTools() adds type on every entry	✅ done	The earlier 400 “tools[0].type” error is gone.
Usage fallback (input_tokens, output_tokens)	N/A yet	Will surface once streaming works, cannot be checked from this run.
previous_response_id stored & reused	N/A yet	Requires at least two turns through the Responses path.

What was implemented
	1.	Tool shape fix – the request now contains the mandatory type field, so the 400 error is resolved.
	2.	Most of the structural scaffolding (new builder, branch to responses.create) appears to compile.

What is still missing
	1.	Turn on useResponses automatically for o3/o4

this.useResponses =
  (config.preferResponses ?? true) && modelSupportsResponses(config.model);


	2.	Marshal plain text into input / instructions

input: extractText(lastUser),
instructions: systemMsgs || undefined,


	3.	Replace the old delta parser with the typed-event loop

for await (const e of stream) {
  switch (e.event) {
    case 'outputTextDelta':          // …
    case 'toolCallCreated':          // …
    case 'functionCallArgumentsDelta':
    case 'toolCallDone':
    case 'responseCompleted':
  }
}

(You’ll start seeing live chunks right after this lands.)

Together those three items complete the remaining unchecked boxes in the “06-pro.md” list  ￼ and should make the example script stream tokens under the Responses banner instead of falling back to legacy chat completions.
